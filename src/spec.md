# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the landing screen’s central proposal/question headline so the initial view shows only the two existing call-to-action buttons over the floating-hearts background.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove/hide the headline/question text on the initial (not accepted) landing state.
- Keep the existing two-button layout and interactions unchanged (evasive “No” + clickable “Yessss miss madam baby ji”).
- Ensure the acceptance flow remains the same (click “Yessss…” triggers confetti and shows the heart-shaped reveal card).

**User-visible outcome:** On first load, users see only the two existing buttons on the floating-hearts background; clicking “Yessss miss madam baby ji” still celebrates with confetti and reveals the existing heart card, while “No” still evades interaction.
